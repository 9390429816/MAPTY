Mapty is a web application designed for tracking workouts and visualizing them on a map. It's an ideal tool for fitness enthusiasts who want to monitor their exercise routines, such as running, cycling, or walking, while also keeping track of their performance metrics like distance, duration, and location.

Key Features of Mapty:

1.Workout Logging: Users can input details about their workouts, including type, distance, duration, and location. This data is then saved for future reference.

2.Geolocation: Mapty uses geolocation to pinpoint where the workout took place, and then marks this on an interactive map. This allows users to visualize their routes and see where they’ve been exercising.

3.Map Integration: The application integrates with a mapping service (like Leaflet) to display workout locations. Users can click on map markers to view details about each workout.

4.User Interface: Mapty offers a user-friendly interface where users can easily input and view their workout data. The interface typically includes forms for entering workout details, as well as a sidebar or dashboard displaying past workouts.

5.Data Storage: Workouts are stored in the browser’s local storage, so users can keep track of their exercise history without needing an account or internet connection.

6.Performance Analysis: Users can analyze their workout data over time to see trends in their performance, such as improvements in speed, distance, or frequency of workouts.
